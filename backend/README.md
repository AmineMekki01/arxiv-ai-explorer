# ResearchMind Backend

This is the backend service for the ResearchMind application. It exposes a FastAPI server and integrates with PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j, and Ollama.

- API docs: served by FastAPI at /docs once the container is running.
- See docker-compose.yml for service orchestration.

This README exists to satisfy the packaging configuration in pyproject.toml (`readme = "README.md"`).
