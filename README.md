**Next-Generation Intelligent Research Assistant with Multi-Agent Architecture**

## üß† Project Overview

ResearchMind is an advanced AI-powered research assistant that goes beyond simple document search to provide truly intelligent research support. Built with a multi-agent architecture and context engineering, it transforms how researchers discover, analyze, and synthesize academic knowledge.

### The Problem I'm Solving

Researchers today face information overload:
- **arXiv alone** publishes 200+ new CS papers daily
- **Traditional search** misses semantic relationships and context
- **Manual literature review** takes months for comprehensive coverage
- **Isolated tools** don't understand research workflows or build knowledge over time

### My Solution: Intelligent Multi-Agent Research Ecosystem

ResearchMind employs specialized AI agents that work together to understand your research context, discover relevant papers, analyze content deeply, and help you build knowledge systematically.

## üéØ Core Capabilities

### ü§ñ Intelligent Agent System
- **Primary Research Agent**: Master orchestrator that understands your research intent and coordinates specialized agents
- **Content Analysis Agent**: Deep semantic understanding of papers, extracting key contributions, methodologies, and limitations
- **Discovery Agent**: Finds relevant papers through citation networks and semantic relationships, not just keyword matching
- **Synthesis Agent**: Creates comprehensive literature reviews and identifies research gaps
- **Critique Agent**: Evaluates methodology quality and identifies potential issues

### üß¨ Advanced Context Engineering
- **Personal Research Context**: Learns your research history, interests, and working style
- **Domain Knowledge Context**: Understands field-specific terminology and research evolution
- **Dynamic Query Context**: Builds understanding progressively through conversation
- **Adaptive Context Windows**: Manages information relevance across different time scales

### üóÑÔ∏è Knowledge Graph Intelligence
- **Dynamic Graph Construction**: Builds knowledge graphs from paper content and citations
- **Relationship Discovery**: Maps connections between concepts, methods, and researchers
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies emerging research directions and declining areas
- **Research Path Planning**: Suggests optimal learning sequences through literature
